## Pricing Philosophy

Pricing is tied to:
- Business outcomes
- Operational savings
- Revenue recovery

Not tied to:
- Tokens
- Minutes
- Infrastructure costs (those are internal)

---

## Primary Pricing Models

### 1. Per Location / Per Property Subscription

Best for:
- Hotels
- Clinics
- Auto shops
- Assisted living facilities

Example pricing:
- $199 – $499 / month (entry tier)
- $799 – $1,499 / month (full automation)

Advantages:
- Predictable revenue
- Easy budgeting for customers

---

### 2. Per Booking / Per Lead Fee

Best for:
- Home services
- Healthcare
- High-value hospitality bookings

Example:
- $1 – $5 per confirmed appointment
- $10 – $50 per high-value booking

Advantages:
- Easy ROI justification
- Scales with success

---

### 3. Revenue Share / GMV Take Rate

Best for:
- Luxury hospitality
- Concierge-driven experiences

Example:
- 1–5% of incremental booking or experience GMV

Advantages:
- Strong alignment
- Higher upside per customer

---

## Blended Pricing (Recommended)

Most customers will land in:
- Base subscription
- + usage-based or performance-based fees

Example:
- $399/month + $2 per booking

---

## Unit Economics (Illustrative)

### Revenue Per Customer (Annual)

| Segment | ARR / Customer |
|-------|----------------|
| Boutique Hotel | $6k – $18k |
| Healthcare Clinic | $3k – $12k |
| Assisted Living Facility | $6k – $20k |
| Home Services Business | $2k – $10k |
| Auto Shop | $2k – $8k |

---

### Cost Structure (Per Customer)

- Infrastructure (voice + LLM): 10–20%
- Support & Ops: 10–15%
- Hosting & monitoring: ~5%

**Target Gross Margin:** 65–80%

---

## Expansion & Upsell

Natural expansion paths:
- More workflows
- Additional phone lines
- Multi-location rollouts
- Analytics & reporting add-ons
- After-hours or overflow handling

---

## Why This Works Economically

- Infrastructure costs decline over time
- Workflow value compounds
- Switching costs increase
- Customers anchor on outcomes, not usage

---

## Summary

This is a **high-margin application business**, not a metered API business.

The goal is:
- Low friction entry
- Clear ROI
- Expand revenue per customer over time
