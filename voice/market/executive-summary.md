# Voice Agent Applications — Executive Summary

## The Opportunity

### Voice Is the Next Default Business UI

Millions of businesses still rely on phones for:
- Bookings and reservations
- Scheduling and rescheduling
- Intake and triage
- Dispatch and concierge services

Missed calls equal lost revenue.  
Staffing phones is expensive, unreliable, and impossible to scale 24/7.

### What Changed

Voice agents historically failed because:
- Speech recognition was brittle
- Latency felt unnatural
- Systems were scripted and fragile
- Deployment required heavy custom engineering

Today, that has changed:
- Realtime speech-to-speech works
- LLMs understand intent, not scripts
- Voice infrastructure is commoditized and affordable

**Voice agents can now replace real operational work — not just IVRs.**

## Target Market (U.S. SAM)

Application-layer voice agents across five verticals:

| Segment | U.S. SAM |
|------|---------|
| Luxury Boutique Hotels | $500M – $2B |
| Healthcare Scheduling | $800M – $3B |
| Assisted Living & Home Care | $600M – $2B |
| Home Services (HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical, Pest) | $700M – $3B |
| Auto Services (Repair & Maintenance) | $600M – $2.5B |
| **Total** | **$3.2B – $12.5B annually** |

This represents **recurring, outcome-driven software spend**, not infrastructure or services.

---

## What We Build

We build **application-layer voice agents** that:
- Answer phones
- Execute business workflows
- Book, schedule, dispatch, and coordinate
- Escalate only when necessary

This is not:
- An API
- An agent builder
- A horizontal platform

This is **software that delivers outcomes**.

---

## Why We Win

### Differentiation

| Others | Us |
|------|----|
| Horizontal agent builders | Vertical-first applications |
| Sell tools | Sell outcomes |
| Require setup and tuning | Opinionated workflows |
| Chat-first mindset | Voice-native from day one |

### Product Moat

- Deep workflow orchestration
- Vertical-specific logic
- Embedded in daily operations
- Switching costs increase over time

Infrastructure will commoditize.  
**Workflow ownership will not.**

---

## Business Model

- Per-location or per-property subscriptions
- Plus per-booking or performance-based fees
- High-margin software (65–80% gross margins)
- Clear ROI enables fast sales cycles

---

## Competitive Landscape

### Infrastructure Providers (Dependencies, Not Competitors)

- OpenAI (Realtime LLM + speech)
- ElevenLabs (TTS)
- Deepgram (STT)
- Twilio / Bandwidth (Telephony)

These providers compete on price and performance — not workflows.

---

### Horizontal Voice Platforms

Examples:
- Retell
- Vapi
- Bland.ai
- PolyAI
- Kore.ai

Common limitations:
- Sell tools, not outcomes
- Require customers to design workflows
- Often fail in real operational environments

---

### Vertical Point Solutions

Examples:
- Simple healthcare schedulers
- Call-answering services for home services
- Chat-based hospitality concierges

Limitations:
- Narrow scope
- Poor extensibility
- Voice often secondary

---

## Our Position

We sit **above infrastructure** and **below platforms**:
Infrastructure (commoditized)
↓
Application-Layer Voice Agent
↓
Real Business Workflows


We own:
- Phone-based workflows
- Business logic and state
- Escalation rules
- Customer trust

**Once embedded, we are difficult to replace.**
- Embedded in daily operations
- Trained on real workflows
- Switching costs rise with usage
- Value compounds over time

| -------------- | ----- | --------- | ------------ |
| Voice-native   | ✅     | ⚠️        | ✅            |
| Workflow depth | ❌     | ⚠️        | ✅            |

| Easy to buy    | ❌     | ⚠️        | ✅            |
| Defensible     | ❌     | ⚠️        | ✅            |

## Why Now

- Voice finally works
- Labor shortages are structural
- Phones still matter
- Buyers are actively seeking automation

This window did not exist five years ago.

---

## Key Takeaway

The winners in voice will not be the companies with the best models.

They will be the companies that:
- Quietly run the phones
- Own the workflows
- Deliver measurable outcomes

We deliver:
- Not “AI agents”
- But operational infrastructure disguised as software

- That’s where enduring value lives.

**Voice is the UI.  
Workflows are the moat.**
