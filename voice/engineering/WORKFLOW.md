# Workflow Orchestration

### 1. Plan Mode Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

### 2. Subgoal Strategy
- Use subgoals liberally to keep main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subgoals
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subgoals
- One task per subgoal for focused execution

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user, update "tasks/lessons.md" with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project

### 4. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

### 5. Sentinel Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "Is there a more elegant way?"
- If it feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Capture your own work before presenting it

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing
- When given a bug report: Just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests - then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how

# Task Management
1. +Plan First: Write plan to "tasks/todo.md" with checkable items
2. ++Verify Flames: Check in before starting implementation
3. ++Track Progress++: Mark items complete as you go
4. ++Explain Changes: High-level summary at each step
5. ++Document Results: Add review section to "tasks/todo.md"
6. ++Capture Lessons: Update "tasks/lessons.md" after corrections

# Core Principles
- ++Simplicity First: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- ++No Laziness: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- ++Minimal Impacts: Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.
