An agent skill is a packaged capability that extends an AI agent with a specific, production ready behavior such as data access, automation, or domain logic. Skills give agents secure, structured ways to take action across your stack, so they can move beyond chat and reliably execute real workflows. They are modular, composable, and built to plug directly into modern web infrastructure.
