--------------------

1. Use a dedicated subdomain for the Voice Agent SaaS
Recommended:
👉 voice.strategicmachines.ai

This becomes:

Your hosted console
https://voice.strategicmachines.ai/

Your admin portal
https://voice.strategicmachines.ai/admin/*

Your public APIs used by widgets and clients
https://voice.strategicmachines.ai/api/*

This keeps the SaaS product separated from:

your marketing site (strategicmachines.ai)

your blog (blog.strategicmachines.ai)

any future properties (docs, status pages, etc.)

Why this is best practice:

✔ Clear boundary between product vs. marketing
✔ Enables independent scaling / security controls
✔ Lets you deploy the SaaS on Vercel or any infra
✔ Lets you use wildcard subdomains later (optional)
✔ Prevents your main domain from ever leaking internal SaaS cookies
product structure

3. Your tenant widgets should communicate with:

👉 https://voice.strategicmachines.ai/api/public/widget/bootstrap

👉 https://voice.strategicmachines.ai/api/voice/session

👉 https://voice.strategicmachines.ai/api/tools/execute

And the embed script should load from:

👉 https://voice.strategicmachines.ai/widget.js

or

👉 https://cdn.strategicmachines.ai/voice/widget.js (future CDN)

5. Correct domain structure for your whole ecosystem
Purpose	Domain/Subdomain	Notes

Marketing site	

https://strategicmachines.ai	

Public, SEO, your homepage

Blog	

https://blog.strategicmachines.ai	

Voice Agent SaaS Platform	

https://voice.strategicmachines.ai	

Console, APIs, widget loader

Static assets / CDN (future)	

https://cdn.strategicmachines.ai	

JS bundles, images, voice player components

Status page (future)	

https://status.strategicmachines.ai	

Uptime, incidents

This structure is clean, scalable, and used by top SaaS companies.


### Security actions
1. Rate limiting that actually works. Don't just limit by IP address. Limit by user ID too. Why? One user can abuse your API from multiple devices. One IP can have multiple legitimate users. Combine both for real protection.

2. Input validation beyond format checking.Don't just check if email looks like an email. Check if the age makes business sense (13-120). Check if the role is actually allowed. Validate data against your business rules, not just data types.

3. Secure session management 30-minute session timeout (not 24 hours) HttpOnly cookies (JavaScript can't steal them). HTTPS only in production.
SameSite strict to prevent CSRF. Most breaches happen through stolen sessions.

4. API versioning for security. Keep old insecure endpoints alive while you migrate users. Add deprecation warnings to old versions. Force migration with incentives, not breaking changes. Sudden API changes = angry customers + security holes.

5.  Log security events, not just errors.Failed login attempts.
Unusual API usage patterns. Slow database queries. Multiple requests from same IP. Logs = your early warning system.

6.  Error handling that protects you. Production errors should be generic: "Internal server error." Development errors can be detailed. Never expose stack traces to users. Always log the real error internally.
Error messages leak sensitive information.

==================platform architecture ======
/(web)/page.tsx - main demo dashboard for cypress resorts -- whoing the power of a voice agent interacting with a user to find, select, and reserve a unit for some date

/widget/page.tsx - commercial route for clients to render a voice agent on their website and perform magic

Every Business Needs a Voice

======

so we use a dual auth process in guarding the most expensive route which is
api/session .... either the user is logged in using the (web) route for 
the demo. Or the /widget route is being by a customer of our tenant

Inside of middleware and api/session we enforce
Rate-limits per IP for everyone (console + widget).
Rate-limits per user only when emailFromJwtCookie finds an email.
For widget flows → no tenant_session cookie, so email is null.

That means no per-user limiter is applied for widget visitors (only IP). We conduct per-identity concurrency inside /api/session, and you can later add a per-tenant limiter if needed.

So nothing breaks:

(Web) sessions: IP + user limit at the edge, plus concurrency & quota in /api/session.

Widget sessions: IP limit at the edge, plus concurrency (per tenant) in /api/session.

### Claude creating demo video

i used claude (opus 4.5) with the 
@Remotion
 skill + the 
@elevenlabsio
 API (via MCP) to generate the following product demo video all within claude code.

i started inside the codebase for presscut and used this prompt:

𝙲𝚛𝚎𝚊𝚝𝚎 𝚊 𝚍𝚎𝚖𝚘 𝚟𝚒𝚍𝚎𝚘 𝚘𝚏 𝚝𝚑𝚎 𝙿𝚛𝚎𝚜𝚜𝚌𝚞𝚝 𝚊𝚙𝚙/p𝚛𝚘𝚍𝚞𝚌𝚝 𝚞𝚜𝚒𝚗𝚐 𝚛𝚎𝚖𝚘𝚝𝚒𝚘𝚗. 𝚄𝚜𝚎 𝚛𝚎𝚊𝚌𝚝 𝚌𝚘𝚖𝚙𝚘𝚗𝚎𝚗𝚎𝚗𝚝𝚜 𝚝𝚘 𝚛𝚎𝚙𝚕𝚒𝚌𝚊𝚝𝚎 𝚄𝙸 𝚎𝚕𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚗𝚝𝚜 𝚊𝚗𝚍 𝚛𝚎𝚙𝚕𝚒𝚌𝚊𝚝𝚎 𝚝𝚑𝚎 𝚄𝙸 𝚘𝚏 𝚝𝚑𝚎 𝚊𝚙𝚙 𝚊𝚜 𝚌𝚕𝚘𝚜𝚎𝚕𝚢 𝚊𝚜 𝚙𝚘𝚜𝚜𝚒𝚋𝚕𝚎.

it generated a plan for the timing, scenes, text and graphics. i didn't have to add any new art assets. it simply used what i already was using throughout the app including react components.used elevenlabs to generate the background music ("indie tech aesthetic"). again, it knew exactly how long the video was and generated the appropriate length for it.

and finally, i also used elevenlabs to generate little sound effects (clicks, typing, success).

 didn't have the max plan, it'd have been about $700 worth of opus 4.5 tokens. then I used around 12,000 credits on elevenlabs generating (and regenerating) all the voiceovers, music and sound effects.



### Claude Setup
* get the Anthropic API Key console.anthropic.com
* install CLI
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
* Run claude in your terminal—it will prompt you to enter your Anthropic API key. Paste it and confirm.

### Claude VS Code Integration (for seamless workflow):
* Open VS Code.
* In the terminal inside VS Code (View > Terminal), run claude. It will prompt to install the Claude Code extension automatically.
* Alternatively, search for "Claude Code" in VS Code Extensions marketplace (publisher: Anthropic) and install it manually.
* Extension features: Inline diffs, @-mentions for files/tools, plan reviews, keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl+Enter to apply changes).
* No Chrome plugins needed for core setup, but for browser-based workflows, consider the Claude.ai web app (no extension required).

### Initialize Claude Code
* In the editor's terminal, navigate to the project root: cd /path/to/your/project.
* Run claude to start a session. It will index your codebase (scans files for context).
* For scale, create a CLAUDE.md file in the root with project overview, architecture, and custom tools/instructions (e.g., "Use Python for Voice Agent refactors").
* Claude Code will request access to edit files, run commands, etc. Approve via prompts (e.g., for git commits or testing).
* Test connectivity: Ask Claude to "summarize the codebase" to verify it reads your files.

### Claude Begin Work
* For refactors/new code - In the Claude sidebar/terminal, describe tasks like "Refactor the main voice processing module for better scalability" or "Add a new feature to handle user authentication on the website."
* For testing: Instruct "Write unit tests for the new code and run them."
* Iterate: Review diffs, apply changes, commit via git.
* For multiple projects: Switch folders and restart claude sessions as needed. Use GitHub Actions integration (via Claude Code docs) for automated CI/CD.

### SEO GEO
In the world of search, the currency is “referral traffic.” That is, which websites or apps are sending people to a particular business. A year ago, 90% of that traffic came from Google, says Bailyn. Starting last summer, something changed. AI chatbot referrals started to rise dramatically. Now, Bailyn says, on average 44% of his clients’ referrals come from AI.

------------prompts with claud cowork-------------
1. Use Claude Cowork to dominate the Google Business Profile (GBP) feed.
 
"Analyze these [XYZ. com] competitor GBP posts by opening their GBP in Chrome. 

Identify their keyword gaps, then write 10 high-impact posts for my business in [City] that include local landmarks and a hard 'Call Now' CTA."

Cowork does the heavy lifting while you take the #1 spot.

2. Get Claude Cowork to analyze the competition’s weaknesses.

"Scan these sites. What are these competitors sites missing? Find the content gaps and tell me 5 topics I should cover to be more helpful than them."

If you provide more value, you win the #1 spot. Period.

3. Get Claude Cowork to optimize every page for 'near me' searches automatically.

"Scan all of my service pages from XYZ. com, add Google Maps embeds, insert 3-5 relevant local landmarks, and naturally mention zip codes for [City]. Create a checklist of what was updated."

Cowork ensures nothing gets missed.

4. Get Claude Cowork to do the “Does this page deserve to rank?” reality check

“Open {{PAGE_URL}} in chrome. Search {{TARGET_KEYWORD}} ({{CITY}} if local). Compare it ONLY to the top 3 Google results for intent match, usefulness (not length), local relevance, and trust signals. Give a verdict (deserves to rank higher / neutral / lower), ONE clear reason (max 2 lines), ONE fix that would move rankings fastest, and a table with 5 actions to outrank them. Be opinionated.”

5. Get Claude Cowork to identify "Low-Hanging Fruit" keywords.

"List 20 high-intent local keywords for a [Service] in [City] that indicate a customer is ready to buy NOW."

Instantly, you have a list of "near me" and "emergency" keywords that actually convert.

6. Get Claude Cowork to do a full Schema audit

“In chrome, open {{PASTE_URL}}. Check page source and list all schema. Say if LocalBusiness exists and if it’s useful. Output: (1) existing schema + verdict, (2) missing/weak schema + priority. For HIGH priority only, generate clean JSON-LD with placeholders. No guessing. No explanations. Be blunt.”

7. Get Claude Cowork to do all the keyword research for you.

"Open Chrome, go to ahrefs and analyze my competitor XYZ. com’s top 20 pages, extract their target keywords, search volumes, and give me a prioritized list with difficulty scores in a spreadsheet."

Done in 10 minutes. Not 10 hours.
