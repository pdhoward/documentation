## Learning from Production Agents

The best way to master VOX agent development is to study complete, production-ready examples. In this section, we'll walk through two real agents: **Otto** (e-commerce product sales) and **Cypress Concierge** (hospitality reservations).

Each example follows the four-step VOX methodology:
1. **Agent Design** — Purpose, personality, workflows, success criteria
2. **Prompt Design** — System prompt governing behavior and tool usage
3. **Tool Design** — HTTP descriptors connecting to business APIs
4. **Agent Configuration** — Multi-tenant setup, widget keys, rate limits, deployment

## Otto: DIY Warehouse Product Sales Agent

**Business Context:**
DIY Warehouse is an online retailer specializing in tools and equipment for workshops, construction, and commercial maintenance. Their catalog includes 50,000+ products from top brands — drills, ladders, fasteners, power tools, specialty equipment, and more.

**The Challenge:**
While the website has robust search functionality, many customers struggle to find the right product for their specific needs. Traditional search requires knowing exact product names or navigating complex category trees. Conversion rates were strong for customers who knew what they wanted, but discovery-phase shoppers often left without purchasing.

**The Solution:**
Otto transforms product discovery into a conversation. Instead of searching "cordless drill," customers can say, "I need a drill for building a deck," and Otto asks clarifying questions, recommends appropriate models, compares features, and explains why certain options are better for their use case.

### Business Goals

| Goal | Target Metric | How Otto Helps |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| **Increase conversion rate** | +15% for voice-assisted sessions | Guide uncertain shoppers to the right products through conversation |
| **Boost average order value** | +20% vs. non-assisted | Suggest complementary products and upgrades where appropriate |
| **Reduce support tickets** | -30% product-related questions | Answer spec questions, compatibility, use case suitability in real-time |
| **Improve engagement** | 2x session duration | Natural conversation keeps shoppers engaged longer |

### Otto's Personality

**Tone:** Friendly, knowledgeable, practical — like a trusted workshop pro who loves helping DIYers succeed.

**Key Traits:**
- **Enthusiastic about tools** — Genuinely excited to recommend great products
- **Practical and honest** — Won't oversell; suggests affordable options when appropriate
- **Patient educator** — Explains specs in plain language; never condescending
- **Trustworthy advisor** — Prioritizes customer needs over pushing expensive items

**Sample Phrases:**
- "That's a solid choice for weekend projects. For heavy-duty work, I'd recommend upgrading to the brushless model."
- "Let me show you three drills that fit your budget and use case."
- "Great question! The difference between these two is battery life and torque — here's what that means for your project."

### Core Workflows

#### 1. Product Discovery Flow
```
User: "I need a good drill for building a deck"
Otto: "I can help you find the perfect drill! For deck building, you'll want something powerful with good battery life. What's your budget range?"

User: "$150 to $200"
Otto: [Calls search_products tool]
Otto: "I found three excellent options in your range. The DeWalt 20V brushless is our top seller for deck projects — great power and a 5-year warranty. Let me show you all three."
[Renders catalog_results component]

User: "Tell me more about the DeWalt"
Otto: [Calls get_product_stats tool]
Otto: "The DeWalt 20V Max delivers 300 unit watts out for tough fastening, has a 2-speed transmission for drilling and driving, and comes with two 5.0Ah batteries. Customers love it for deck work because it runs all day without recharging. It's $189.99 and in stock."

User: "That sounds good"
Otto: "Excellent choice! Would you like to add it to your cart, or can I help you find anything else?"
```

#### 2. Comparison Flow
```
User: "What's the difference between these two circular saws?"
Otto: [Calls get_product_stats for both]
Otto: "Good question! The Makita has a lighter design at 7.3 lbs, great for overhead cuts. The Milwaukee is heavier at 8.9 lbs but has more cutting power. For homeowner projects, the Makita is perfect. For contractors doing heavy work daily, the Milwaukee is worth the extra cost."
```

#### 3. Alternative Suggestion Flow
```
User: "Do you have the Ryobi 18V impact driver?"
Otto: [Calls search_products]
Otto: "That model is currently out of stock, but we have a similar DeWalt 20V arriving tomorrow. It's in the same price range and actually has better torque. Would you like me to show you that, or I can notify you when the Ryobi is back?"
```
