## Building Otto: Going Deeper

Now that we have thought out agent design and what we would like to accomplish, lets goo deeper on the 3 key artifacts required to create our Voice Agent and activate it on our web site.

It is important to note that the Strategic Machine's agent platform comes with a number of critical functions which mask complexity and addresses foundational requirements for a Voice Agent. For example, the platform uses commercial-grade language models, which delivers millisecond responses in text-to-speech (TTS) and speech-to-text (STT) functions, with high precision. The platform records a transcript for every interaction, and records a copy for your use. Notification can be built in, monitoring conversation in real-time, and alerting appropriate personnel were needed. The platform has preconfigured components for use by the Agents for rendering images, video or structured information for a customer, in response to questions. All of this and more can be leveraged by you, the Agent developer, providing you with additional assurances about the quality and execution of the agent on your behalf.

## Sample Artifacts for Otto

What follows are sample artifacts for each of the 3 key artifacts required to build and deploy Otto. Your artifacts will differ, obviously, but the structure and content required is representative of what you would need to produce in order successfully instantiate your agent.
