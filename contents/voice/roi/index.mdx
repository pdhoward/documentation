## ROI Analysis: Measuring Voice Agent Value

Voice agents deliver measurable business impact. This guide helps you calculate ROI, set realistic targets, and track value over time.

## ROI Calculator Framework

### Input Variables

**Current Costs (Without Voice Agent):**
- Monthly customer service volume (calls, chats, emails)
- Average handle time per interaction
- Hourly cost per agent (salary + benefits + overhead)
- Conversion rate (if e-commerce/sales)
- Average order value (if applicable)

**Voice Agent Costs:**
- Development/setup (one-time): $5,000-$15,000
- Monthly hosting and API costs: $500-$2,000
- Monthly maintenance: $500-$1,000

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Automation rate (% of interactions handled by voice)
- Conversion lift (% increase in conversion)
- Average order value increase

### ROI Calculation

```
Monthly Savings =
  (Current Volume × Automation Rate × Avg Handle Time × Hourly Cost)
  - Voice Agent Monthly Cost

Revenue Impact =
  (Sessions × Conversion Rate Lift × Avg Order Value)

Total Monthly ROI = Monthly Savings + Revenue Impact

Payback Period =
  One-Time Setup Cost / Total Monthly ROI
```

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Cypress Resort (Hospitality)

**Before Voice Agent:**
- 800 booking inquiries/month via phone
- 12 minutes average call duration
- $25/hour front desk cost
- 45% phone booking conversion rate

**After Voice Agent (3 months):**
- 32% of website visitors use voice agent
- 58% voice session completion rate
- 680 voice-assisted sessions/month
- $127,000 in direct bookings attributed to voice

**Calculation:**
```
Monthly Savings:
  800 calls × 30% automation × 12 min × $25/hour
  = 800 × 0.30 × 0.2 hours × $25
  = $1,200/month in reduced phone time

Revenue Impact:
  680 sessions × 58% completion × $320 avg booking
  = $126,000/month in bookings

Setup Cost: $8,000
Monthly Cost: $850 (OpenAI + hosting)

Net Monthly ROI: $126,000 - $850 = $125,150
Payback Period: $8,000 / $125,150 = 0.06 months (2 days!)
```

### Example 2: DIY Warehouse (E-Commerce)

**Before Voice Agent:**
- 15,000 monthly website visitors
- 2.8% conversion rate
- $87 average order value
- 420 monthly orders = $36,540 revenue

**After Voice Agent (3 months):**
- 18% of visitors engage with voice agent
- 23% higher conversion for voice-assisted sessions
- 31% higher average order value for voice sessions

**Calculation:**
```
Voice Sessions: 15,000 × 18% = 2,700/month

Voice Conversions: 2,700 × (2.8% × 1.23) = 93 orders
Voice AOV: $87 × 1.31 = $114

Additional Revenue: 93 orders × $114 = $10,602/month

Setup Cost: $12,000
Monthly Cost: $1,200

Net Monthly ROI: $10,602 - $1,200 = $9,402
Payback Period: $12,000 / $9,402 = 1.3 months
Annual ROI: ($9,402 × 12) / $12,000 = 940%
```

### Example 3: SupportBot (Customer Service)

**Before Voice Agent:**
- 3,500 support tickets/month
- 45 minutes average resolution time
- $22/hour support agent cost
- 60% tier-1 tickets (simple inquiries)

**After Voice Agent:**
- 55% of tier-1 tickets automated
- 8 minutes average voice resolution
- 85% customer satisfaction

**Calculation:**
```
Tier-1 Tickets: 3,500 × 60% = 2,100
Automated: 2,100 × 55% = 1,155 tickets

Time Saved:
  1,155 tickets × (45 min - 8 min) = 1,155 × 37 min
  = 42,735 minutes = 712 hours

Monthly Savings: 712 hours × $22 = $15,664

Setup Cost: $10,000
Monthly Cost: $1,500

Net Monthly ROI: $15,664 - $1,500 = $14,164
Payback Period: $10,000 / $14,164 = 0.7 months
Annual ROI: ($14,164 × 12) / $10,000 = 1,700%
```
