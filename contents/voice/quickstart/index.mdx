## Using a Template

### Step 1: Choose Your Industry

Select the template that best matches your business:
- **Hospitality** — Hotels, resorts, vacation rentals, restaurants
- **E-Commerce** — Online retail, product marketplaces, subscription services
- **Customer Support** — Help desk, technical support, customer service
- **Healthcare** — Clinics, hospitals, dental offices, therapy practices

### Step 2: Download the Configuration

Each template includes downloadable JSON files:
- `agent-prompt.json` — System prompt
- `http-tools.json` — Tool descriptors
- `tenant-config.json` — Recommended settings

### Step 3: Connect Your APIs

Update tool descriptors with your API endpoints:
1. Replace placeholder URLs with your actual API endpoints
2. Add your API authentication credentials to `secrets`
3. Adjust parameter schemas to match your API requirements

### Step 4: Customize the Prompt

Tailor the system prompt to your brand:
- Update tone to match your brand voice
- Add your business-specific policies
- Include your product/service names
- Adjust conversation examples

### Step 5: Deploy and Test

1. Create a tenant configuration in the VOX platform
2. Upload your customized prompt and tools
3. Generate widget keys for your domain
4. Test in development environment
5. Deploy to production
