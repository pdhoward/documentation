## Interactive Tutorials: Learn by Building

The best way to master VOX is through hands-on practice. These interactive tutorials guide you step-by-step through the agent development process with real-time feedback and validation.

Each tutorial is designed to be completed in 15-30 minutes and provides practical experience with the core concepts covered in the documentation.

## Tutorial Learning Path

We recommend completing tutorials in this order:

### 1. Start with Agent Design
Begin with the **Agent Builder Wizard** to define your agent's purpose, personality, and workflows. This tutorial helps you think through the business requirements before diving into implementation.

**You'll learn:**
- How to scope an agent's capabilities
- Defining personality and brand voice
- Mapping conversation workflows
- Planning data and tool requirements

**Outcome:** A complete agent design document ready for implementation

### 2. Build Your Prompt
Next, use the **Prompt Tester** to experiment with system prompts and see how they influence agent behavior in different scenarios.

**You'll learn:**
- Prompt anatomy and structure
- How to define tool usage rules
- Creating effective conversation examples
- Testing prompts against edge cases

**Outcome:** A validated system prompt that governs agent behavior

### 3. Create Your Tools
Then, move to the **Tool Descriptor Playground** to build HTTP tools that connect your agent to your APIs.

**You'll learn:**
- HTTP tool descriptor schema
- Parameter validation with JSON Schema
- Template syntax and type coercion
- UI rendering with onSuccess/onError

**Outcome:** Working tool descriptors tested against mock APIs

### 4. Configure Your Widget
Finally, use the **Widget Configurator** to generate the embedding code for your website.

**You'll learn:**
- Widget configuration options
- Environment-specific setup
- Customization (position, colors, theme)
- Framework integration (React, Vue, Angular)

**Outcome:** Copy-paste widget code ready for deployment
