## Agent Builder Wizard

This interactive tutorial guides you through designing a complete voice agent from concept to specification. By the end, you'll have a comprehensive agent design document ready for implementation.

**Time to complete:** 20-30 minutes

## How It Works

The wizard walks you through the Five Pillars of Agent Design with guided questions, industry templates, and real-time validation. Your answers are compiled into a downloadable design document.

### The Five Pillars

1. **Purpose & Scope** — Define what problem your agent solves
2. **Personality & Voice** — Establish tone, style, and brand alignment
3. **Conversation Workflows** — Map primary conversation paths
4. **Data & Tools** — Identify required APIs and capabilities
5. **Success Metrics** — Define how you'll measure performance

## Tutorial Interface

<Note type="info">
**Interactive Tutorial Coming Soon**

This tutorial is currently in development. The wizard will include:
- Step-by-step guided questions
- Industry-specific templates (hospitality, e-commerce, support)
- Real-time validation and suggestions
- Side-by-side examples from Otto and Cypress
- Downloadable design document (JSON + Markdown)
- Option to start implementation directly

For now, use the [Agent Design Guide](/voice/agent-design) to manually complete your agent design.

## Preview: Tutorial Flow

### Step 1: Choose Your Industry

Select an industry template to pre-populate common patterns:

- **Hospitality** — Hotel bookings, restaurant reservations, concierge services
- **E-Commerce** — Product sales, recommendations, shopping assistance
- **Customer Support** — Ticket resolution, FAQ automation, troubleshooting
- **Healthcare** — Appointment scheduling, patient intake, insurance verification
- **Real Estate** — Property inquiries, showing scheduling, lead qualification
- **Custom** — Start from scratch for unique use cases

### Step 2: Define Purpose

Answer guided questions:
- What specific problem does this agent solve?
- Who will interact with it? (customers, employees, partners)
- What does a successful interaction look like?
- What should the agent NOT do?

**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "purpose": "Enable hotel guests to search available rooms and complete bookings without phone calls or forms",
  "target_users": ["website visitors", "returning guests", "travel planners"],
  "success_criteria": ["booking completed", "availability confirmed", "guest information collected"],
  "out_of_scope": ["cancellations", "complaint handling", "loyalty program management"]
}
```

### Step 3: Establish Personality

Define tone, style, and brand voice:
- Formal or casual?
- Energetic or calm?
- Concise or detailed?
- Empathetic or neutral?

**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "tone": "warm, attentive, professional",
  "style": "like a luxury hotel concierge — anticipate needs, confirm details",
  "boundaries": "doesn't handle cancellations or complaints (escalates to human)",
  "sample_phrases": [
    "I'd be delighted to help you find the perfect room",
    "Let me check availability for you"
  ]
}
```

### Step 4: Map Workflows

Build conversation flows with visual flowchart builder:
1. Greeting & Intent Detection
2. Information Gathering
3. Tool Execution (search, book, confirm)
4. Confirmation & Next Steps
5. Edge Cases & Escalation

**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "primary_flow": [
    "Greet warmly and detect booking intent",
    "Gather check-in/out dates and guest count",
    "Call search_units tool",
    "Display available rooms with photos",
    "Confirm selection and create reservation",
    "Show booking confirmation"
  ],
  "edge_cases": {
    "no_availability": "Suggest alternative dates or room types",
    "user_changes_mind": "Gracefully restart search",
    "complaint": "Empathize and escalate to human support"
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Plan Tools & Data

Identify required integrations:
- What real-time data does the agent need? (inventory, pricing, availability)
- What actions must it perform? (create booking, send email, update CRM)
- What APIs provide this data?
- What authentication is required?

**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "data_requirements": [
    "Real-time room availability by dates",
    "Room details (photos, amenities, pricing)",
    "Guest reservation management"
  ],
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "search_units",
      "purpose": "Query available rooms by check-in/out dates",
      "api": "https://your-hotel.com/api/units/search",
      "auth": "Bearer token"
    },
    {
      "name": "create_reservation",
      "purpose": "Book a room for the guest",
      "api": "https://your-hotel.com/api/reservations",
      "auth": "Bearer token"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 6: Define Success Metrics

Set measurable goals and operational limits:
- Conversation completion rate target
- Average session duration
- Escalation rate threshold
- Concurrent session limits
- Budget constraints

**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "metrics": {
    "completion_rate": "60%+",
    "avg_session_duration": "less than 5 minutes",
    "escalation_rate": "less than 10%",
    "customer_satisfaction": "4.5/5 or higher"
  },
  "limits": {
    "max_concurrent_sessions": 20,
    "max_session_duration": "15 minutes",
    "daily_token_cap": 300000
  }
}
```

## Export Options

When you complete the wizard, you can export:

1. **Design Document (Markdown)** — Human-readable specification for stakeholders
2. **Configuration JSON** — Machine-readable format for direct import
3. **Implementation Checklist** — Step-by-step tasks for developers
4. **Agent Prompt Starter** — Pre-filled system prompt template based on your design

## Using Your Design Document
