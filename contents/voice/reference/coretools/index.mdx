## Core Tools Reference

VOX agents have access to a suite of built-in platform tools that provide essential capabilities without requiring custom HTTP integrations. These core tools handle common operations like time queries, web scraping, and UI component rendering.

All core tools are automatically available to agents — no configuration required.

## Platform Tools

### getCurrentTime

Returns the current date and time for the agent's timezone.

**Purpose:** Enables time-aware responses and date calculations

**Parameters:**
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {},
  "required": []
}
```

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "currentTime": "2025-01-23T14:30:00Z",
  "timezone": "America/Chicago",
  "formatted": "Thursday, January 23, 2025 at 2:30 PM CST"
}
```

**Example Usage:**
```
User: "Is the restaurant still open?"
Agent: Calls getCurrentTime() → 8:45 PM
Agent: "The restaurant closes at 9 PM, so yes, you have 15 minutes to order."
```

**When to Use:**
- Scheduling and availability queries
- Greeting based on time of day
- Date calculations (days until, time since)
- Business hours validation

### show_component

Renders a UI component in the conversation interface.

**Purpose:** Display rich visual content like product catalogs, alerts, booking confirmations

**Parameters:**
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "component_name": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Name of the component to render",
      "enum": [
        "catalog_results",
        "alert",
        "booking_confirmation",
        "property_card",
        "comparison_table",
        "image_gallery"
      ]
    },
    "props": {
      "type": "object",
      "description": "Component-specific properties"
    }
  },
  "required": ["component_name", "props"]
}
```

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "rendered": true,
  "componentId": "cmp_abc123"
}
```

**Example Usage:**
```
Agent calls:
  show_component({
    component_name: "catalog_results",
    props: {
      title: "Available Drills",
      items: [
        { id: "1", name: "DeWalt 20V", price: 189.99, image: "..." },
        { id: "2", name: "Makita 18V", price: 149.99, image: "..." }
      ],
      currency: "USD"
    }
  })

User sees:
  Visual product cards with images, names, prices
```

**When to Use:**
- Display search results
- Show booking confirmations
- Render alerts or notifications
- Present comparison tables

**Component Reference:** See [UI Components Reference](/voice/reference/components) for all available components and their props.

### scrapeWebsite

Fetches and extracts text content from a public URL.

**Purpose:** Retrieve real-time information from websites when APIs aren't available

**Parameters:**
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "url": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "uri",
      "description": "Public URL to scrape"
    }
  },
  "required": ["url"]
}
```

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "url": "https://example.com/page",
  "title": "Page Title",
  "content": "Extracted text content...",
  "length": 1500
}
```

**Example Usage:**
```
User: "What are your pool hours?"
Agent: Calls scrapeWebsite({ url: "https://resort.com/amenities" })
Agent: "The pool is open daily from 6 AM to 10 PM."
```

**Limitations:**
- Only works on public URLs (no authentication)
- Returns text content only (no structured data)
- Subject to rate limits (max 10 requests per session)
- Not recommended for frequently changing data (use HTTP tools instead)

**When to Use:**
- One-time lookups of public information
- Fallback when API isn't available
- FAQ or policy retrieval

**When NOT to Use:**
- Real-time inventory or availability (use HTTP tools)
- Authenticated content
- Frequent repeated lookups

---

## Tool Invocation Rules

### Automatic vs Explicit

**Automatic Tools:**
- `getCurrentTime` — Called automatically when time context is needed
- No need to explicitly prompt "use getCurrentTime"

**Explicit Tools:**
- `show_component` — Must be explicitly called in response to user queries
- `scrapeWebsite` — Called when agent needs external data

### Tool Call Sequencing

Agents can call multiple tools in sequence:

```
Turn 1:
  User: "Show me drills under $200"

  Agent calls:
    1. search_products({ query: "drills", max_price: 200 })
    2. show_component({
         component_name: "catalog_results",
         props: { items: search_results }
       })
```

### Error Handling

If a tool call fails, the agent should gracefully handle it:

```
Tool call: scrapeWebsite({ url: "https://invalid-url.com" })

Response:
  { "success": false, "error": "Failed to fetch URL" }

Agent should:
  - Acknowledge the failure
  - Offer alternative (ask user, try different source)
  - Never pretend the tool succeeded
```

## Tool Call Validation

The platform validates all tool calls before execution:

**Validates:**
- Parameter types match schema
- Required parameters present
- Enum values are valid
- URLs are well-formed

**Rejects with error:**
```json
{
  "error": "Invalid tool call",
  "code": "INVALID_PARAMETERS",
  "details": "Missing required parameter: component_name"
}
```

## Usage Limits

Core tools have usage limits to prevent abuse:

| Tool | Limit | Window | Reason |
|------|-------|--------|--------|
| `getCurrentTime` | Unlimited | - | Lightweight |
| `show_component` | 20 calls | Per session | Prevent UI spam |
| `scrapeWebsite` | 10 calls | Per session | External rate limits |

## Custom vs Core Tools

**Use Core Tools When:**
- Functionality is generic (time, UI, public web scraping)
- No authentication or business logic required
- Built-in capability meets your needs

**Use HTTP Tools When:**
- Integrating with your own APIs
- Need authentication or API keys
- Business-specific operations (inventory, bookings, CRM)
- Structured data with complex schemas

**Example:**
- ✅ Use `getCurrentTime` for time checks
- ❌ Don't build a custom HTTP tool for time
- ✅ Use HTTP tool for your booking API
- ❌ Don't try to use `scrapeWebsite` for authenticated inventory
